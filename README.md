## Learning 
In this project, I learn how to use the Java mail send library, how to crate to create the file aplication.properties using the extension .yaml, and how to attribute ENV(environmental variable) in my project for better security. I learned how to use the SOLID architecture to create a directory contract and implement the interface to my other class, like a contract, attributing only one function for each class.
